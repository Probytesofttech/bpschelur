                        <h3>Why <span class="color">Bharath public school</span></h3>
                        <p>We firmly believe that a child who is exposed to a multitude of experiences, as opposed to being solely focused on book-learning, is the kind of child who grows up to excel socially, emotionally and professionally in a inter-dependent and complex world. These influences are gently introduced into the child’s perspective over his or her time at Bharath public school through  Co-Curricular activities..</p>
                        <p>Co-Curricular programmes at Bharath public school range from Sports and Creative Arts, to Field Trips, Community Outreach helping develop interpersonal, leadership and communication skills in children. Year-round literary and cultural competitions called the Tournaments of Minds, and the House system we have in place reinforce team spirit and confidence. These activities give children the impetus, in an atmosphere of constructive and healthy competition to discover individual talents, work in collaboration and to become high achievers..</p>

                                <p>The special educators and the counsellor also run group sessions, addressing age related issues. Teachers use whole-group instruction for introducing ideas, planning or sharing results, then let children work individually or in groups, based on readiness, interest and learning style. Ongoing assessments help identify children who need more support, and those who need to be placed in an accelerated learning programme.</p>

                                <p>A common infrastructure is used to meet the needs of both ends of the spectrum, customizing toolsets to meet the specific case of each child. The activities are administered by members of the faculty, trained in the use of the tool set. Modern equipment complements the use of our own indigenous methods of learning and emphasizes their effectiveness in the treatment of learning disorders..</p>
